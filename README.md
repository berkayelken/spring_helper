# Bananazura Spring Helper

This project is created for general solutions for spring framework. 

# Initial Version

This version include exception handling, logging mechanism, and handling rest controller fail scenarios with aop facilities.

# Exception Handling

The rest_aop_helper project provides exception handling with Aspect-Oriented-Programming manner. When Bananazura Aspects are enbaled, developer can be careless about exception handling. That is why, aop catches exceptions automatically, and it can create log for error. Also, it can be create a fail scenario for rest services. Therefore, developer can focus main and business concerns without thinking about cross-cutting concerns.
